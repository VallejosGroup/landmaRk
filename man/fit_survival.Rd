\item{x}{An object of class \code{\link{LandmarkAnalysis}}.}

submodel is fitted.}

\details{
\subsection{Mathematical formulation}{

This function estimates the conditional probability of survival to horizon
\eqn{s+w}, conditioned on having survived to the landmark time, \eqn{s},
that is
\deqn{\pi_i(s+w \vert s) = P(T_i > s+w \vert T_i \ge s, \bar{x}_i(s)), }
where \eqn{i} denotes an individual's index, \eqn{T_i} is the time to event
outcome for individual \eqn{i} and \eqn{\bar{x}_i(s)} are the covariates
observed for individual \eqn{i}, including the observed history of dynamic
covariates.
