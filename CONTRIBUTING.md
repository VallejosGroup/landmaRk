[documentation](https://vallejosgroup.github.io/landmaRk/) and [issue
list](https://github.com/vallejosgroup/landmaRk/issues) to see if it
isn’t included or suggested yet. If not, suggest your idea as an [issue
on GitHub](https://github.com/vallejosgroup/landmaRk/issues/new). While
we can’t promise to implement your idea, it helps to:

- Explain in detail how it would work.
- Keep the scope as narrow as possible.

See below if you want to contribute code for your idea as well.

### Report a bug 🐛

Using landmaRk and discovered a bug? That’s annoying! Don’t let others
have the same experience and report it as an [issue on
GitHub](https://github.com/vallejosgroup/landmaRk/issues/new) so we can
fix it. A good bug report makes it easier for us to do so, so please
include:

- Your operating system name and version (e.g. Mac OS 10.13.6).
- Any details about your local setup that might be helpful in
  troubleshooting.
- Detailed steps to reproduce the bug.

### Improve the documentation 📖

Noticed a typo on the website? Think a function could use a better
example? Good documentation makes all the difference, so your help to
improve it is very welcome!

#### The website

[This website](https://vallejosgroup.github.io/landmaRk/) is generated
with [`pkgdown`](https://pkgdown.r-lib.org/). That means we don’t have
to write any html: content is pulled together from documentation in the
code, vignettes,
[Markdown](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/)
files, the package `DESCRIPTION` and `_pkgdown.yml` settings. If you
know your way around `pkgdown`, you can [propose a file
change](https://help.github.com/articles/editing-files-in-another-user-s-repository/)
to improve documentation. If not, [report an
issue](https://github.com/vallejosgroup/landmaRk/issues/new) and we can
point you in the right direction.

#### Function documentation

Functions are described as comments near their code and translated to
documentation using [`roxygen2`](https://klutometis.github.io/roxygen/).
If you want to improve a function description:

1.  Go to `R/` directory in the [code
    repository](https://github.com/vallejosgroup/landmaRk).
2.  Look for the file with the name of the function.
3.  [Propose a file
    change](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/working-with-files/managing-files/editing-files)
    to update the function documentation in the roxygen comments
    (starting with `#'`).
